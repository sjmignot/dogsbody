Note, *from the emptiness*.  
not *of the emptiness*.  

Should be odd: this from.  
emptiness  
being, after all, passive,  
too passive to issue  
from anything.  
      To not just be  
latently, there:  
        **OF**.  

Just as we are, a vapid congealing of molecules: generously,  
    a bungling.  

Just as we are vague, passable interpretations of a reified beyond, dissected and personally cultivated  
      in private gardens. So, I can, for example, tell you,  
      The Magnolias are pushy this time of year, and you can respond:  
        a) Magnolias... Magnolias... Good lord those are Hydrangeas,  
        or, better yet, b) pretend that you see them too...  

Emptiness is that which takes:  
wants to be full.  

To emerge from what is without  
is to efface the very place that bears, right?  

Unless emptiness is what you leave behind:  
any movement inventing the ghost that haunts it.  

Or perhaps just the name we give what we abandon,  
the brief or infinite space, waked as you flow  
filling the space you are assigned.
