I have decided to write, obviously:  
an inevitable mistake, probably.  

Here, in this electronic concert, suffused,  
I have selected, chosen,  
the absolute agony of language—self-suspension  
by the tongue.  
               Decided to process myself:  
to be drawn again and again through  
the wheel, the great gears  
of language until every part of me is  
nothing but its name and then nothing.  

I have chosen,  
  when confronted by the precise opposite:  
  sound devoid of meaning, raw  
  and loping, a shawl, the strong sailors  
  arm that pulls us out of the river of our  
  own, intense self-conciousness, out of language,  
  into the beautiful sanctuary of self-  
  annihilation: leaving only leaps of sound  
  daring like the broken tacking of butterflies,  
  the encompassing peace waking the slow slink  
  out of our minds,  
poetry.  

What a stupid mistake  
I have made,  
and will make again.  

To fall for language, words,  
          these concrete boots I slip on  
to wander the riverbed. The rock that carries me  
down into the lonly beauty of deep water, that I must leave behind  
to return, let go of or drown.  

As I dive for pearls like bleached  
      stars in the pitch depths, the water like a second, heavier sky,  

Then resurfacing, moving vertically, creating the microcurrents, the very absense to  
pull us upwards: and it is always absense, emptiness that draws us, moves us  
forward.  

We are like how the wind moves. Gasping.  

The air moving to where it is not.  

And I must find a new rock, and another,  
then leave them all behind, a nest of heavy stones in the deep  
underwater, as though  
      Atlantis is yet to come, will be built from the abandoned stones  
            of our dives.  

From the stones moving to where they are not.
