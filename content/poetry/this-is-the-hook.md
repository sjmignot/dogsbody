falling into beds we made.
Making the falls, weighed
by the pull,

making the summer
red as the sun through
our eyelids.

Though sometimes the
brightness folds, scatters:
fish darting below
the murk-line,
keeping their fiery scales.

      all I can,
  all I know: is
the singular beauty that they
are not necessary
       with you,

You do not sprinkle
fishfood, as for my
soul: trying to lure brightness
instead of letting me ride out the sadness.

they swim, surface, dive, die, live:
you understand, things inside us
    can have lives of their own.

the pinhole catches the same world
that a window fumbles.

Lying on the ground, we hear
the sound of all things
which sink and flow by
our feet.

So the fish must be sad,
must be happy, must wait
in the depths.

And this is the hook.
    sharp
  but it will drag us
into the light.

the darkness peeling
as we pass through layers of water.

like eyelids getting thinner and thinner
burning up through the
  atmosphere of waves
        burning up into light.
