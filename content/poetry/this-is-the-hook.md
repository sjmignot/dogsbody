<p>For less than a second</p>
<p>Our lives will collide</p>
<p>The endless suspended</p>
<p>The door opened wide</p>
<br/>
<p>And she will be born</p>
<p>To someone like you</p>
<p>What I left undone</p>
<p>She will certainly do</p>
<br/>
<p>I know she is coming</p>
<p>And I know she will look</p>
<p>And that is the longing</p>
<p>And this is the hook</p>

falling into beds we made.  
Making the falls, weighed  
by the pull,  

making the summer  
red as the sun through  
our eyelids.  

Though sometimes the  
brightness folds, scatters:  
fish darting below  
the murk-line,  
keeping their fiery scales.  

      all I can,  
  all I know: is  
the singular beauty that they  
are not necessary  
       with you,  

You do not sprinkle  
fishfood, as for my  
soul: trying to lure brightness  
instead of letting me ride out the sadness.  

the fish: they swim, surface, dive, die, multiply:  
you understand, things inside us  
    can have lives of their own.  

the pinhole catches the same world  
that the window fumbles.  

Lying on the ground, we hear  
the sound of all things  
which otheriwise sink and drift  
by our feet.  

So the fish must be sad,  
must be happy, must wait  

for the hook.  
    sharp  
  but it will drag us  
into the light.  

the darkness peeling  
as we pass through layers of water.  

like eyelids getting thinner and thinner  
burning up through the  
  atmosphere of waves  
        burning up into light.
