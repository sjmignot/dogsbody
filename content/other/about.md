I don't like writing about myself: even a little third person trickery doesn't make the process comfortable.

Though, I must like writing about myself because I enjoy writing, which is, inevitably, a distilling and sieving of the self through words.

Perhaps what I like is writing about myself by proxy: letting the books, movies, music, art that I love cast shadows of me on the wall.

This idea rationalizes both the creation of [my blog](/posts) and the methodology that I want to apply to it:

I don't want to pretend that my reviews and thoughts are directly about the topic of a post. I want to affirm and declaim the beauty of that which bounces around and mixes inside us, which is, after all, where art comes alive.
