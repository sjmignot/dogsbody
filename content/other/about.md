title: About

I don't like writing about myself: even a little third person trickery doesn't make the process comfortable for Samuel Mignot.

Though, I do like writing about myself because I like writing and writing is distilling and sieving oneself through words.

Perhaps what I like is writing about myself through what I like: letting the books, movies, music, art that I love cast shadows of me on the wall.

This rationalizes the creation of my blog and as the methodology that I want to apply to it:

I don't want to pretend that my reviews an thoughts are directly about the topic of a post. I want to affirm and declaim the beauty of that which bounces around and mixes inside us.
