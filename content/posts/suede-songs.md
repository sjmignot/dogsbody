This weeks playlist is ghost themed. The title draws inspiration from [Zachary Schomburg](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/zachary-schomburg)'s brilliant poem _Scary, No Scary_.

## 1. Spooky Ghosts, SNCKPACK

The first song on the playlist, SNCKPACK's _Spooky Ghosts_, launched me on my ghost quest. The song is tender and heartwarming. Though, I have to admit I'm a sucker for ukulele riffs and tender lyrics.

## 2. Another Song About Ghosts, Joy Again
## 3. Ghost Town, The Specials
## 4. Ghosteen, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds
## 5. Ghost Mouth, Girls
## 6. Ghost Ship, Blur
## 7. Henry (Acid Ghost Version), Soccer Mommy
## 8. Living Ghost, Joy Again
