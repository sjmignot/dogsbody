This weeks playlist is rather themeless, but shaped around the first song: Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas) by The So So Glos.

## Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas), THe So So Glos

The first song on the playlist, SNCKPACK's _Spooky Ghosts_, launched me on my ghost quest. The song is tender and heartwarming. Though, I have to admit I'm a sucker for ukulele riffs and tender lyrics.
