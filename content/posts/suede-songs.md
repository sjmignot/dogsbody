This weeks playlist is rather themeless, but shaped around the first song: Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas) by The So So Glos.

## 1. Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas), The So So Glos

The first song on the playlist, SNCKPACK's _Spooky Ghosts_, launched me on my ghost quest. The song is tender and heartwarming. Though, I have to admit I'm a sucker for ukulele riffs and tender lyrics.

## 2. Bobby, (Sandy) Alex G
## 3. Don't Ever Leave Me, Bob Marley & The Wailers
## 4. Linda Ronstadt, AJJ
## 5. The Bug Collector, Haley Heynderickx
## 6. The Bus Song, Jay Som
