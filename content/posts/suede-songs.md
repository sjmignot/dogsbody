This weeks playlist is rather themeless, but shaped around the first song: Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas) by The So So Glos.

## Mold Baby (& The Queen Midas), The So So Glos

The first song on the playlist, Mold Baby was buried in my main playlist and popped up on shuffle. I looped it for the rest of the day. Sent one of my friends the song with a tagline of "This is rather spiritual," not necessarily knowing what I meant, but knowing that it was true, at least for me (though I in no way consider myself spiritual, having conflated it with strong emotional resonance).

## Bobby, (Sandy) Alex G

Having long been obsessed with the character Bobby from Twin Peaks, I decided to like this song before first hearing it (a pratice which can be rewarding but also deeply disappointing. See ).

## Don't Ever Leave Me, Bob Marley & The Wailers
## Linda Ronstadt, AJJ
## The Bug Collector, Haley Heynderickx
## The Bus Song, Jay Som
## Cure for Pain, Morphine
