Prometheus created humanity and stole fire from the gods for them. As punishment, he is chained to a rock in Caucasus and his liver is pecked out by eagles whereupon it regenerates so the process can continue forever.

In *Prometheus Unbound*, Percy Shelley made Prometheus into a Romantic hero:  

> It doth repent me; words are quick and vain;  
> Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine.  
> I wish no living thing to suffer pain.  
>  
> <cite> -- Percy Shelley, Prometheus Unbound[^1]</cite>

In *Frankenstein*, Mary Shelley envisions a modern Prometheus: a tortured monster who utters, what is to me, one of the most powerful lines in English literature.

> If I cannot inspire love then I will cause fear
>  
> <cite> -- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein[^2]</cite>

In his film *The Lighthouse*, Eggers creates a postmodern Prometheus.

## Extending the myth of Prometheus

In his film *The Lighthouse* Eggers extends the myth of Prometheus into the self-indulgence and complexity of modernity.

The link to the myth is most explict in the final shot of the film: Pattinson's character is sprawled on the rocks, seagulls eating his entrails. This forces a retroactive mapping of the story onto the myth.

Though this mythological mapping leaves important gaps, I don't think Prometheus is a one-off reference. Escpecially with the repeated flamelike and divine symbolism of *the light of the lighthouse*.

The primary gap follows: if Pattinson's character steals the lighthouse flame, then how does he share it with humanity. Doesn't this also imply that Defoe's character, as the original owner of the flame, is divine[^3]?
