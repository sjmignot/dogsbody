Prometheus creates humanity from clay. Seeing them cold and suffering, he gives them fire which he steals from the gods. 

As punishment, he is chained to a rock in Caucasus. His liver is pecked out by eagles and regenerates in the night, allowing the process to continue forever.

In *Prometheus Unbound*, Percy Shelley reimagines Prometheus as a Romantic hero. A beacon of emotion, innovation, sensitivity.

> It doth repent me; words are quick and vain;  
> Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine.  
> I wish no living thing to suffer pain.  
>  
> <cite> -- Percy Shelley, Prometheus Unbound[^1]</cite>

In *Frankenstein*, Mary Shelley envisions a modern Prometheus: a tortured monster who utters, what is to me, one of the most powerful lines in English literature.

> If I cannot inspire love then I will cause fear
>  
> <cite> -- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein[^2]</cite>

In his film *The Lighthouse*, Eggers continues this tradition and creates a postmodern Prometheus.

## Extending the myth of Prometheus

Eggers extends the myth of Prometheus into the self-indulgence and complexity of modernity.

The link to the myth is most explict in the final shot of the film: Pattinson's character is sprawled on the rocks, seagulls eating his entrails. This forces a retroactive mapping of the story onto the myth: the analogy.

Though this mythological mapping leaves important gaps, I don't think Prometheus is a one-off reference. Escpecially with the repeated flamelike and divine symbolism of *the light of the lighthouse*.

The primary gap follows: if Pattinson's character steals the lighthouse flame, then how does he share it with humanity. Doesn't this also imply that Defoe's character, as the original owner of the flame, is divine[^3]?

## Leading the camera, sharing the light

In film, the camera is often closely connected to characters and their movements. Specifically, the camera connects us to the characters it chooses to connect us to: for example, showing us what they see with an eyeline match.

It is Pattinson's character who leads us into the ligthouse, into an inner sanctum that seems like it's out of a science fiction movie. Briefly, we see it all. The light, the lens, the room. By reaching it himself, Thomas Howard indirectly gives us the light.

We see what we sees. At least we do before he tumbles down the stairs and dies. Eggers imperfect, postmodern prometheus shares the arc of his analog: stealing the light, giving it to us, and being punished for it. However, his motives are egotistical, obsessive. His world lonely. His gift coincidental.
