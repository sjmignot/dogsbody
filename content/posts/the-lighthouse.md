Prometheus creates humanity from clay. Seeing them cold and suffering, he gives them fire which he steals from the gods. 

As punishment, he is chained to a rock in Caucasus. His liver is pecked out by eagles and regenerates in the night, allowing the process to continue forever.

In *Prometheus Unbound*, Percy Shelley reimagines Prometheus as a Romantic hero. A beacon of emotion, innovation, sensitivity.

> It doth repent me; words are quick and vain;  
> Grief for awhile is blind, and so was mine.  
> I wish no living thing to suffer pain.  
>  
> <cite> -- Percy Shelley, Prometheus Unbound[^1]</cite>

In *Frankenstein*, Mary Shelley envisions a modern Prometheus: a tortured monster who utters, what is to me, one of the most powerful lines in English literature.

> If I cannot inspire love then I will cause fear
>  
> <cite> -- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein[^2]</cite>

In his film *The Lighthouse*, Eggers continues this tradition and creates a postmodern Prometheus.

## Extending the myth of Prometheus

Eggers extends the myth of Prometheus into the self-indulgence and complexity of modernity.

The link to the myth is most explict in the final shot of the film: Pattinson's character is sprawled on the rocks, seagulls eating his entrails. This forces a retroactive mapping of the story onto the myth: the analogy.

Prometheus isn't a one-off reference. The flamelike symbolism of *the light of the lighthouse* can be mapped to stolen fire. Besides, Eggers explicitly mentions his adpotion of the myth in an interview with Vox saying: "Well, Prometheus and Proteus never hung out in any Greek myths before, but that seems to be what is kind of happening here". He goes on to say "Prometheus might be taking on some characteristics that he hasn’t in the past. But you know what? The classical authors did that all the time"[^3].

It is important to pin down what these characteristics are, especially after using a term as protean as postmodernist to define him.

Though this mythological mapping leaves important gaps
The primary gap follows: if Pattinson's character steals the lighthouse flame, then how does he share it with humanity.

## Leading the camera, sharing the light

In film, the camera is often closely connected to characters and their movements. Specifically, the camera connects us to the characters it chooses to connect us to: for example, showing us what they see with an eyeline match.

In his brilliant video essay on Cuarón's film Children of Men, titled [Don't Ignore the Background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-woNlmVcdjc&has_verified=1), Evan Puschak talks about the process of identification.

> In thousand of films we interpret the world through the eyes of the main character. This process of identification is automatic and strong. So strong that we can even be made to sympathize with people who are bad or evil. So when the camera actively breaks that identification and shows us imagery the lead character doesn't see or notice we're made forcefully aware, in a purely visual way, of the perspective of the film itself.

It is Pattinson's character, Thomas Howard, who leads us into the ligthouse, into an inner sanctum that seems like it's out of a science fiction movie. Briefly, we see it all. The light, the lens, the room. By reaching it himself, Howard indirectly gives us the light.

We see what he sees. At least we do before he tumbles down the stairs and dies. Eggers imperfect, postmodern prometheus shares the arc of his analog: stealing fire, giving it to us, and being punished for it. However, his motives are egotistical, obsessive. His world lonely. His gift coincidental.
