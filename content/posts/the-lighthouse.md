Prometheus created humanity and stole fire from the gods for them. As punishment, he is chained to a rock in Caucasus and his liver is pecked out by eagles whereupon it regenerates so the process can continue forever. In his film *The Lighthouse* Eggers revives the myth, or at least imagery from the myth. For example, in the final shot of the film, Pattinson's character is sprawled on the rocks, seagulls eating his entrails.

This leaves important gaps in the Prometheus-Lighthouse analogy, which I don't think is a one-off reference, specifically when there is something as flamelike and divine as the *the light of the lighthouse*, which characters are grappling for possession of.

The primary gap follows: if Pattinson's character steals the lighthouse flame, then how does he share it with humanity.

## Leading the camera, sharing the light
