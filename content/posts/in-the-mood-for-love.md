Wong Kar-Wai’s film In the Mood for Love is a beautiful project that on first reflection seems destined to fail.

It tells the story of two neighbors who develop a relationship as they begin to suspect their respective partners of affairs. They grow close but are committed to not make the same mistakes.

The story is beautiful, but the medium of film seems antagonistic to the intimacy and contained humanity that Wong’s characters need. The movie must work against a number of difficult dynamics:

The platonic intimacy of the characters set against the incidentally cold/observational and voyeuristic nature of filmmaking and framing.
I don’t mean to say that to make a film is to agree to some kind of intrinsic, insurmountable power-dynamic, but rather to point out that there is a one-way glass between a viewer and visual art. You see but are not seen back. This relationship can of course be complicated (see: Paris Texas, A Taste of Cherry) but it cannot be removed—not that it should be: framing is an essential part of what makes visual art beautiful and meaningful.

I mean to propose, more than anything, that we as viewers should not feel entitled to characters and that a film shouldn’t simply give them to us. This is especially essential for a film like In the Mood for Love whose characters form a close, personal, secretive, but also vulnerable relationship. To prevent the camera from overwhelming the characters and the story, the film must find ways to place distance and obscurity between us and the character. The film must also get the audience to accept this distance as an essential part of the story.

In some scenes Wong provides us with a decently direct view of his characters where we see their faces, but still his compositions are layered. The above frame comes from a shot that opens with the bottom fourth cut off. There are plants in the foreground and a partially opened window that creates an additional frame inside the shot. The room that our characters are in is further blocked off by the outer walls of the building.

We are given access to the room through the window but are not allowed into it—the camera (and consequently the viewer) are not allowed in the room. Nonetheless, the open window implies that we are not looking into the scene uninvited; we have permission to look into the room, but it is a permission that we are given not one that we are entitled to.

The shot also reminded me of Richard Diebenkorn’s 1959 painting Coffee (shown below): both seem to offer personality through obfuscation. In both images the character’s face is blocked but made more expressive. I believe this serves as a greater metaphor for Wong Kar-Wai film: the shots and framing in In the Mood for Love are blocked but more expressive as a result.

Wong consistently reframes and softens his shots. The film’s cinematography and set design take advantage of

obstructions in the foreground
contrasting colors/patterns
frames inside frames
orientation of characters
mirrors and reflections
repeating colors/patterns
camera movement
shadows
This post contains various frames that demonstrate some of those techniques. However, frames can only do so much to illustrate the dynamic beauty and complexity of the films shots (in short, watch the film).

This is also the reason why I love Magritte’s painting Lovers II. It rejects our natural instinct to possess characters and art—to see everything: their eyes, their faces, how they feel. It covers their heads. The man wears a clichéd black suit with a black tie like he could be literally anybody. The cloth condemns us to not understand them.

However, the cloth doesn’t affect them. They see everything that they want to see because their eyes are closed and their lips can (clearly) still kiss through the cloth. Their faces, the cynosure of the painting, are only known by the characters. We must accept, for once, that the characters do not belong to us. Their secrets expressions are buried in cloth

Our desire for a romance that would contradict the very reasons we want it (and disassemble our protagonists)
I will examine this idea in less depth, but I think this operational paradox is an essential component of In the Mood for Love.

In watching In the Mood for Love we want the characters to fall in love. We want romance; we want them to get together. The whole extended final scene that teases reunion to play off this desire. However, just as the characters do, we must realize that the essential dynamic of the film depends on being able to maintain a distinction between the protagonists and their partners; a distinction that requires the characters to be platonic. (Though as an aside this provides further questions on what love is. Does love has to be physical. Their avoidance of physical intimacy doesn’t prevent them from being in love. In fact, as an audience they seem far more intimate than their spouses because they are far more human (though this is all material for a longer post and further analysis)).

In the Mood for Love stresses this idea continuously by not showing their partners faces and having the protagonists act as their partners to try to understand them.

The very title In the Mood for Love seems another wink at the tension between our desire for romance and its unrealizability.

This tension stresses the aforementioned freedom of the characters from us as viewers.

They will not realize what we want and that’s damn beautiful in its own right.

But I ramble…such is my curse…

Go watch the film.
