What does a film leave you with? When the credits roll. When the screen goes black. When you have to find the remote, turn off the television, or get out of your seat and push through the large double door of the screening room. When you turn on the light or when the light goes on in the room.

Do you want to go back? Do you wish that the film was still playing. Do you just sit, wherever you were sitting, and let it weigh on you. Do you look at whoever watched it with you? Look into their eyes and try to see whether they saw what you saw. 

Do you get back on with your life or do you feel like something irrevocable has happened, and if something has changed, are you still, waiting for it to sink in?

Breaking the Waves struck me. The film finished and I was still. I watched the credits, which had weird character highlights for each actor (the way some films from the 90's do). I was watching with my mom and godmother, so I couldn't just sit there staring at a blank screen. 

Lars Von Trier has an uncompromising vision. When he has passion for his characters, his films are stunning. When he loses this, they are unbearable.

Each of Trier's film is a balancing act between misanthropy and faith.

## Misanthropy 

When Trier loses empathy, his films—despite stunning cinematography, technical prowess, impressive acting—fall flat. 

A movie can be [immensely dark but still deeply and profoundly empathic](posts/an-elephant-sitting-still): this empathy can be a redeeming force. Trier's film Breaking the Waves falls into this category. 

And characters don't rage against their circumstances, they simply persist. This is especially frustrating because the film piles on explosive, sudden events, what Justin Chang perfectly describes in his LA Times review as "a soap opera season’s worth of romantic indiscretions, sudden deaths, unfortunate accidents, provoked and unprovoked attacks"[^1].

These events lack their natural function: in the soap opera tradition they exist to incite strong emotional reactions, adding modulation to characters who otherwise would appear excedingly flat.

Instead, as disasters befall them, Bo's characters become more entrenched in who they are. Not inspired to act, but rather convinced that acting is meaningless[^2]. The persistence and transformation in *An Elephant Sitting Still* reminds me of *Macbeth*, specifically the "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow" soliloquy.

> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,  
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,  
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale  
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  
> Signifying nothing.

> <cite>-- Shakespeare, Macbeth[^3]</cite>

Macbeth certainly could have proved an inspiration for Hu Bo's film: his mentor Bela Tarr directed an adaption, which it is altogether probable that Bo saw.

I stress the importance of hope in art, but have never been bothered by it's relative absence in Shakespeare's tragedies. Or, if I've considered it, I've always concluded that the beauty of the language redeems the violence of the content. After all, isn't beauty a kind of hope?

The same mechanisms must be at play in *An Elephant Sitting Still*. I left the film depressed, but also deeply moved. Frustrated, but disabused from the idea that art cannot be profoundly bleak.

## Faith 

It would be easy to misread Breaking the Waves as a blistering attack on faith. Without the last scene, such a reading even seems reasonable.

## Sound and music

Although Bo's film is long, it is masterfully paced. Bo develops the same form of [slow suspense that Tarkovsky uses in Andrei Rublev](/post/andrei-rublev).

Though the product of a myrriad of elements, the excellent pacing of the film is closely tied to music, and, even more so, silence.

More and more often, I am aware and dissapointed by the reliance of films on music for emotional impact. Most recently, I noticed this in Phillips' Joker and Gray's Ad Astra and the television series Mr. Robot.

In each of these, dramatic background music is injected in the background of speeches.

Yet, if the writing is good enough, if the acting is good enough, then it doesn't need to be.

Putting dramatic music in the background of a movie speech is like putting floaties on a swimmer: if they don't know how to swim it'll probably keep them from drowning, if they're trying to get somewhere it'll slow them down, if they're professionals it'll be a goddamn catastrophy.

The modern overmusicing of movies always brings back to Chaplin's *The Great Dictator*: the final speech.

The film was made in 1940, but the writing is impeccable, the acting killer. Without music, the speech is real, raw, honest.

Yet, the most viewed version of the speech on Youtube is overlayed with Hans Zimmer's Time...

This dependence hurts music and film, but is also indicative of a greater reliance on sound: silence is becomming less and less of an option. Silence is
