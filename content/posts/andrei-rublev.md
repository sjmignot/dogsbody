It is hard to unpack a Tarkovsky film. You take any thread, start pulling and it turns out to be the entire tapestry. Which is not to say that his movies are simple. Rather that everything is linked. The length of the thread is time and time ducks into itself.

Watching a film you leave with moments ducked into each other: composite

## Suspense in the ringing of the bell

Tarkovsky is not known for suspense: he is known for long takes, and slow cinema. But, in the final chapter of Andrei Rublevcontructs a beautiful, grounding, human, and suspensful scene. Though it isn't the kind of scene that causes hearts to leap or armchairs to be knuckled. It is slow suspense, that catches you in the slow give and pull of the scene.

Tarkovsky foreshadows conflict: with character believing the coat for the making of a bell will not hold, but the bell holds. It is strange that the suspense does not end there. Because there are things we carry that trascend.

## A parallel of sound and color

After witnessing the horrors of a barbarian invasion, Rublev takes a vow of silence. At the end of the film, the vow is broken which as accompanied with a different but equally significant unmuting. The film, which is nearly entirely in black and white, switches to color.
