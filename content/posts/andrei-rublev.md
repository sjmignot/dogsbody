It is hard to unpack a Tarkovsky film. You take any thread, start pulling and it turns out to be the entire tapestry. Which is not to say that his movies are simple. Rather that everything is linked. The length of the thread is time and time ducks into itself.

Watching a film you leave with moments ducked into each other: composite

## Suspense in the ringing of the bell

Tarkovsky is not known for suspense: he is known for long takes, and slow cinema. But, in the final chapter of Andrei Rublevcontructs a beautiful, grounding, human, and suspensful scene. Though it isn't the kind of scene that causes hearts to leap or armchairs to be knuckled. It is slow suspense, that catches you in the slow give and pull of the scene.


Tarkovsky foreshadows conflict: with character believing the coat for the making of a bell will not hold, but the bell holds. It is strange that the suspense does not end there. Because there are things we carry that trascend.

And

> Kolya Burlyaev as Boriska, the bell-caster's son in Audrey Rublyov was working with me for the second time after Ivan's Childhood. All the time we were shooting I had to give him to understand through my assistants that I was thoroughly dissatisfied with his work, and might retake his scenes using another actor. I wanted him to feel disaster hanging over him, perhaps about to fall, so that he would genuinely be feeling acutely insecure. Burlyaev is an extraordinarily dissipated, shallow and ostentatious actor. His bursts of temperament are artificial. That was why I had to have recourse to such severe measures. Even so his performance was not on the same level as that of my favourite actors.

## A parallel of sound and color

After witnessing the horrors of a barbarian invasion, Rublev takes a vow of silence. At the end of the film, the vow is broken which as accompanied with a different but equally significant unmuting. The film, which is nearly entirely in black and white, switches to color.

> As Hermann Hesse says in The Glass Bead Game, 'Truth has to be lived, not taught. Prepare for battle!' A movement becomes truthful, that is, capable of transforming tradition into social energy, only when the history of that tradition, the way it grows and changes, coincides with (or even overtakes) the objective logic of the development of society. Indeed, Hesse's words quoted above could well serve as an epigraph to Audrey Rublyov. Underlying the concept of Andrey Rublyov's character is the schema of a return to the beginning; I hope this emerges in the film as the natural and organic progression of the 'free' flow of life created on the screen. For us the story of Rublyov is really the story of a 'taught', or imposed concept, which burns up in the atmosphere of living reality to arise again from the ashes as a fresh and newlydiscovered truth.

> The monk, Rublyov, looked at the world with unprotected, childlike eyes, and preached love, goodness and non-resistance to evil. And though he found himself witnessing the most brutal and devastating forms of violence, which seemed to hold sway in the world and led him to bitter disillusionment, he came back in the end to that same truth, rediscovered for himself, about the value of human goodness, of openhearted love which docs not count the cost, the one real gift which people can give each other.

> I am reminded of how we worked on Andrey Rublyov. The film is set in the fifteenth century, and it turned out to be excruciatingly difficult to picture 'how everything was'. We had to use any sources we could: architecture, the written word, Jiconography. Had we gone for reconstruction of the picturesque tradition of the picturesque world of those times, the result would have been a stylised, conventional ancient Russian world, of the kind that at best is reminiscent of miniatures or icons of the period. But for cinema that is not the right way. I have never understood, for instance, attempts to construct mise en scene from a painting. All you will be doing is bringing the painting back to life, and duly being rewarded with superficial acclaim: 'Ah, what a feeling for the period!' 'Ah, what cultivated people!' But you will also be killing cinema. Therefore one of the aims of our work was to reconstruct for a modern audience the real world of the fifteenth century, that is, to present that world in such a way that costume, speech, life-style and architecture would not give the audience any feeling of relic, of antiquarian rarity. In order to achieve the truth of direct observation, what one might almost term physiological truth, we had to move away from the truth of archaeology and ethnography. Inevitably there was an element of artificiality, but this was the antithesis of that of the revived painting.
