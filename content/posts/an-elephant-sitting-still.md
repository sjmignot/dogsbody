The film is 4 hours long. I watched it at the Brady Theater. When it was over, everyone sat watching the credits. I watched the film at 8pm and got out of the theater at midnight. It was raining lightly and my phone was dead.

I knew the general direction I needed to travel to get home, but Paris is full of sickle shaped streets: it took me an hour longer than it should have. All the while, I was stuck thinking about redemptive beauty.

## Redemptive Beauty

Specifically, I was repeating a lyric from Leonard Cohen's song [Anthem](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aAE5KL20Uycf3dswsaHjp?si=rosh5vBKQOaNVAMgghYuNQ).

> There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in. That's how the light gets in.
>
> -- Leonard Cohen, Anthem

Ever since I tried to read Bukowski's novel Factotum and was left feeling appalingly depressed by the absolute emptiness and lack of hope, the presence of beauty in Drama has become exceedingly important for me.

For a long while, I thought art couldn't be beautiful, impactful, good, unless it had something inside it to redeem all the horror and bleakness: the crack in which the light gets in.
