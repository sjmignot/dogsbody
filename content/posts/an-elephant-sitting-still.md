The film is 4 hours long. I watched it at the Brady Theater. When it was over, everyone sat watching the credits. I watched the film at 8pm and got out of the theater at midnight. It was raining lightly and my phone was dead.

I knew the general direction I needed to travel to get home, but Paris is full of sickle shaped streets: it took me an hour longer than it should have. All the while, I was stuck thinking about redemptive beauty.

## Redemptive Beauty

Specifically, I was repeating a lyric from Leonard Cohen's song [Anthem](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aAE5KL20Uycf3dswsaHjp?si=rosh5vBKQOaNVAMgghYuNQ).

> There is a crack in everything.  
> That's how the light gets in.  
> That's how the light gets in.  
>
> <cite>-- Leonard Cohen, Anthem</cite>

Ever since I tried to read Bukowski's novel Factotum and was left feeling appalingly depressed by the absolute emptiness and lack of hope, the presence of beauty in Drama has become exceedingly important for me.

For a long while, I thought art couldn't be beautiful, impactful, good, unless it had something inside it to redeem all the horror and bleakness: the crack in which the light gets in.

## Fault and culpability

In Bo's An Elephant Sitting Still, characters ceaselessly blame each other. Yu Cheng blames both his girlfriend and his ex for the death of his friend, and his parents blame him for the death of his brother. Wei Bu blames his friend for revealing his location to his parents, and a bully blames that same friend for the theft of a cellphone. The owner of the stray dog blames Wang Jin, inexplicably. Wang Yuwen's teacher blames her for ruining his career.

The central question is why do all these characters feel a need to exteriorize their anguish into blame: a pattern that continues on and on, into perpetual redirection and resolves nothing. I considered a few possible explanations: a redirection.

I was also curious what this meant for a culture that is "collectivist". Putting aside the fact that individualism and collectivism are too all emcompasing to mean much, the idea of blame seems antithetical to community (beyond scapegoating).
