This weeks playlist is ghost themed. The title draws inspiration from [Zachary Schomburg](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/zachary-schomburg)'s brilliant poem _Scary, No Scary_.

## Spooky Ghosts, SNCKPACK

The first song on the playlist, SNCKPACK's _Spooky Ghosts_, launched me on my ghost quest. The song is tender and heartwarming. Though, I have to admit I'm a sucker for ukulele riffs and tender lyrics.

> Lets put the bedsheets over our heads.  
> We'll be spooky ghosts together, in our beds.


## Another Song About Ghosts, Joy Again

Joy Again is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. After hearing them open for Rostam in SF, their songs have been following me.

> I treat my body like shit, but I have nothing to lose  
> Except my physical form which I barely use

Witty, sarcastic, absurd, lyrically sound, tender, I believe Joy Again is going to keep doing great things!

## Ghost Town, The Specials

Obviously, **Ghost Town** is a ghost-themed playlist requirement. This special Special's hit moves smoothly between unique and diverse passages.

> Why must the youth fight against themselves?  
> Government leaving the youth on the shelf

## Ghosteen, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds

Haunting yet spiritual. Visceral but tender. Although undeniably dark, Cave's music is aglow with something more: a yearning to be free, to be happy. An obsidian radiance that grows in the darkness, stronger for it. His album Ghosteen, its title song, seem the high tide of a hope long dormant in Cave's work.

> This world is beautiful  
> Held within it's stars

## Ghost Ship, Blur

Off of Blur's latest album *The Magic Whip*, Ghost Ship has a beautiful underlying rhythm. Nothing seems fixed in the foreground or background of the song: rather, everything seems to weave in and out.

> I got away for a little while  
> But then it came back much harder

## Ghost Song, Jim Morrison

Releasesd posthumously on The Doors final album *An American Prayer*, Ghost Song is a brilliant example of Morrison's stunning songwriting:

> Awake.  
> Shake dreams from your hair  
> my pretty child, my sweet one.  
> Choose the day and choose the sign of your day  
> the day's divinity  
> First thing you see.

## Living Ghost, Joy Again

Another song about ghosts by joy again, Living Ghost has a lo-fi sound, but is all the better for it. Lyrical decisions, such as the pluralization of sky so that it rhymes with rise, add a rawness to their sound that resolves into a kind of emotional honesty.

> will the sun rise  
> up in the skies  
> just to shortly return.
