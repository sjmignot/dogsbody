This weeks playlist is ghost themed. The title draws inspiration from [Zachary Schomburg](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/zachary-schomburg)'s brilliant poem _Scary, No Scary_.

## 1. Spooky Ghosts, SNCKPACK

The first song on the playlist, SNCKPACK's _Spooky Ghosts_, launched me on my ghost quest. The song is tender and heartwarming. Though, I have to admit I'm a sucker for ukulele riffs and tender lyrics.

> Lets put the bedsheets over our heads. We'll be spooky ghosts together, in our beds.


## 2. Another Song About Ghosts, Joy Again

Joy Again is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. After hearing them open for Rostam in SF, their songs have been following me.

> I treat my body like shit, but I have nothing to lose
> Except my physical form which I barely use

Witty, sarcastic, absurd, lyrically sound, 

## 3. Ghost Town, The Specials

Obviously, **Ghost Town** is a ghost-themed playlist requirement. This special Special's hit moves between haunting passages impeccably.

> Why must the youth fight against themselves?
> Government leaving the youth on the shelf

## 4. Ghosteen, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds


## 5. Ghost Mouth, Girls
## 6. Ghost Ship, Blur
## 7. Henry (Acid Ghost Version), Soccer Mommy
## 8. Living Ghost, Joy Again
