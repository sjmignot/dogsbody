B. H. Fairchild's poem "What He Said", is stunnning, ethereal, and rhythmic.

<pre class='poem'>
WHAT HE SAID, B.H. FAIRCHILD

When Candi Baumeister announced to us all
that J. D. was in love with Brigitte Bardot,
drawing those two syllables out like some kid
stretching the pink strands of Dubble Bubble
from between her teeth, J. D. chose
not to duck his head in the unjust shame
of the truly innocent, but rather lifted it
in the way of his father scanning the sky
in silent prayer for the grace of rain abundant
upon his doomed soybeans or St. Francis
blessing sparrows or the air itself, eyes radiant
with Truth and Jesus and said Babydoll,
I would walk on my tongue from here to Amarillo
Just to wash her dishes.
                         There is a time
in the long affliction of our spoken lives when,
among all the verbal bungling, stupidity,
and general disorder that burden us
like the ragged garment of flesh itself, when,
beneath the vast and articulate shadows
of the saints of language, the white dove of genius
with its quick, wild wings has entered our souls,
our immaculate ignorance, and we are,
at last, redeemed. And so is conceived and born
the thing said, finally, well nay perfectly—
as it might be said by that unknowable Being
for whom we have in our mortal linguistic
incapacity no adequate name except the one
Candi Baumeister bore in her own virginal
moment of absolute poetry : My God, J. D.

Maybe it’s just me. Though, saying this after a title that pretends to “know all, say all” seems a kind of literary escapism—brackets of reluctance. This is what I have to say, and I will tell you: that should be the approach. Though to say it right requires a recap of my day.

Maybe it’s just me but **João Rosa’s short story The Third Bank of the River is an allegory for consciousness, anxiety, and control**.

So, let’s get on with it:

## Some personal context: American Pastoral and "understanding stories"

My life seems in limbo. Adulthood is just beyond a physics course that I am, at snail-speed, completing. I’m living at home: barely writing, reading, physicsing, and waiting.
